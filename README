  18 Aug 2005 v0.3: bug fix. hours were obtained incorrectly
  25 Feb 2005 v0.2: bug fixes. grads_time() now returns a useful array
  22 Feb 2005 v0.1: first release

This suites consists of awk and ncl scripts.

*awk scripts
**scripts to read file meta information:

	-dset.awk: returns the path to the data file
	-title.awk: returns the title
	-undef.awk: returns the undefined value

**scripts to read coordinates and their meta information:

	-xdef.awk: returns x coordinates
	-ydef.awk: returns y coordinates 
	-yrev.awk: returns -1 if option yrev is found 1 if not
	-zdef.awk: returns z coordinates
	-zrev.awk: returns -1 if option zrev is found 1 if not
	-tdef.awk: returns number of records, units, and increment

**scripts to read variables meta information:

	-varnames.awk: returns variable names
	-varlevs.awk: returns the number of levels for each variable
	-vardescs.awk: returns the description (long name) for each variable
	-varid.awk: returns the place of a give variable name in all variables

*ncl utility script

**grads.ncl

Install .awk and .ncl scripts to appropriate directory.
Here it is assumed that they are installed in:
	$HOME/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/grads/

To use this script first load this script before "begin" statement.

	load "$HOME/lib/ncarg/nclscripts/grads/grads.ncl"

To read meta data use grads_addfile() function.
It simply returns the name of the input but with meta data
such as coordinates as attributes.

		f = grads_addfile("path/to/your/control/file.ctl")

Available attributes are:

	-grd: path to the data file ("DSET")
	-title: "TITLE"
	-undef: "UNDEF"
	-lon: x coorinates
	-lat: y coorinates
	-lev: z coorinates
	-varnames: names of variables
	-varlevs: the number of levels for each variable
	-vardescs: description (long name) of each variable
	-offsets: offset of each variable from the start of the record
	-nlevs: total number of levels per record

Function grads_read() returns a 2D or 3D array at a record:

		x = grads_read(f,f@varnames(0),0)

Function grads_time() returns an array of increments from the initial time
with units as attributes

*Limitations
Parsing is not perfect so there are a numbers of limitations in particular:
-Byte reversing is not supported.
-mixed case such as Xdef, xDef are not supported (xdef, XDEF are OK)
